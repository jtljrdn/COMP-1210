    A year in the modern Gregorian Calendar consists of 365 days.
    In reality, the earth takes longer to rotate around the sun.
    To account for the difference in time, every 4 years, a leap year takes place.
    A leap year is when a year has 366 days: An extra day, February 29th.
    The requirements for a given year to be a leap year are:
    1) The year must be divisible by 4
    2) If the year is a century year (1700, 1800, etc.), the year must be evenly divisible by 400; therefore, both 1700 and 1800 are not leap years

    Some example leap years are 1600, 1712, and 2016.
    Write a program that takes in a year and determines whether that year is a leap year.
